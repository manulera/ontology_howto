## How to annotate genotypes

* I used alleles that have sequence modifications with respect to the wild type gene

  * The allele has been used before:

    Check whether the allele is annotated in Pombase already by visiting the allele section of the gene page.

      * The allele is included, and it has all the information about the sequence that you currently have about it

        TODO: instructions on how to select from existing phenotypes

      * The allele is included, but some of the information about its sequence is missing

        TODO: select the existing, but provide the extra information as a comment -> Can they edit?

  * This allele is first published here

    TODO

    1. The
    2. Workflow

* I used alleles with a tag (fluorescent tag or other)

  If the tag does not cause a phenotype, don't annotate the tagged allele.

  * If tagging creates a phenotype:

    This is valuable information for other researchers that may be interested in this protein.

    TODO: how to create the tagged allele.

## How to annotate GO terms

* I studied the localization of a protein / a protein that is part of a protein complex (GO - Cellular component)
  * Some examples
* I studied the molecular function of a protein (GO - Molecular Function)
  * Some examples
* I studied the role of a protein in a biological process (GO - Biological process)
  * Some examples

NLS etc
